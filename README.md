# MLonGenomics
Exploratory research, in the context of Masters graduation project.  University of Applied Sciences of Western Switzerland (HES-SO MSE). Masters of Science in Engineering program. Complex Information Systems.

# Techniques
Genomic sequence classification with two approaches:
1. NLP/BoW Bag of Words approach with classical machine learning algorithms
2. Deep Learning approach using LSTM/RNN models.

# Data: 
The data is artifitially generated, it consists of 60k DNA sequences, with length between 4999 and 14999 characters. Characters are {A,C,G,T}. 
The same techniques can be applied to any sort of genomic sequences given you have a sufficient computation power.
